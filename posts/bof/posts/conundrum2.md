<h3> Conundrum 2 </h3>

Hi there, some months ago I was given some set of challenges made by `mug3njutsu` for a ctf he wrote challenges for but it got no solve

So I decided to tackle them and was able to solve 3/4 of the challenges for which i made a solution [here](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/bsides_nairaobi/writeup.md)

The last one i wasn't able to do it

At that time i wasn't so much familiar with various techniques so i thought it was a format string one shot sort of exploitation (maybe that's still possible im just not that good yet! ðŸ˜…)

I still had the challenge file saved and while scrolling through challenges i should tackle today i came across it and decided to give it a shot

Now then let's start :)

The challenge came with its glibc file and linker, so the first thing I did was patch it to ensure the same libc would be used on my device as on the remote

```
pwninit --bin conundrum_v2 --libc libc.so.6 --ld ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --no-template
```

Next thing is to get an idea as to what type of file we are working with and the protection enabled on it

We can see that it is a 64 bits executable which is dynamically linked and not stripped and from the protections enabled it's clear that only the stack canary is disblaed

Now i ran the binary to get an overview of what it does

It seems to print some menu, receives our choice and based on the choice provided does some other stuffs

With that in mind i
