<h2> Binary Exploitation </h2>

    - Chall Name: Speedrun 4
     - CTF: Defcon Quals 2019
     
I got this challenge binary from [here](https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare/blob/master/modules/17-stack_pivot/dcquals19_speedrun4/speedrun-004)

You can follow along if you wish to do so!

We are working with a 64bits binary which is statically linked and not stripped (oof)
