So we are working with a x86 executable which is dynamically linked and not stripped

And the protections enabled are: Canary & NX

Running the binary to get an overview of what it does shows this

Basically this binary provides us with a calculator like structure where we can perform about 4 operations on
- Show numbers
- Add number
- Change number
- Get average

Now that we know that I decided to decompile the binary inorder to reverse it and find the vulnerability

**Reversing**

I will look through what each function does and explain ðŸ™‚

First it will receive the number of integers we want to store in the array with it's value
