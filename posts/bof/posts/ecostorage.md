<h2> Binary Exploitation </h2>

    - Chall Name: Ecostorage
     - CTF: THCON22

This was a very cool challenge that took me some amount of hours to solve and I learnt something new while solving it

It shows that not all pwn related challenge involves popping of shells üêö as there are other various things one can do while exploiting a vulnerability in a program

Let's start shall we?

First thing I do always is to know what type of file I'm working with and the protections enabled on it

Cool we are working with a 64bits binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

The following protections are enabled:
- Full Relro
- Stack Canary
- No-Execute
- PIE

What a hassle all protections are enabled!!

To get an overview of what the binary does I ran it and got this

So it seems we can:
- Read File
- Go Premium
- Exit

To figure what privilege or vulnerability this binary provides I decompiled it in Ghidra and here's the main function

Note that I already renamed some variable name and changed some data type for a better understanding

```c
void main(void)

{
  int fp;
  size_t null;
  char *env;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int choice;
  int is_premium;
  int coupon_used;
  undefined8 *where;
  undefined8 write;
  char access_token [72];
  undefined8 canary;
  
  canary = *(undefined8 *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  is_premium = 0;
  coupon_used = 0;
  setvbuf(stdout,(char *)0x0,2,0);
  do {
    while( true ) {
      while( true ) {
        menu(is_premium);
        __isoc99_scanf("%d%*c",&choice);
        if (choice != 2) break;
        if (is_premium == 0) {
          printf("Access token: ");
          fgets(access_token,64,stdin);
          null = strcspn(access_token,"\n");
          access_token[null] = 0x0;
          env = getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN");
          fp = strcmp(access_token,env);
          if (fp == 0) {
            is_premium = 1;
            puts("Premium access successfully activated!");
          }
          else {
            fp = strcmp(access_token,"THCON2022");
            if (fp == 0) {
              if (coupon_used == 0) {
                coupon_used = 1;
                puts("Success! Your coupon is valid.");
                puts("Tell us your 2 lucky numbers, you might win a premium access!");
                __isoc99_scanf("%lu %lu%*c",&where,&write);
                *where = write;
                puts("Thank you for playing, we\'ll contact you soon!");
              }
              else {
                puts("You can\'t use your coupon twice!");
              }
            }
          }
        }
        else {
          is_premium = 0;
        }
      }
      if (choice < 3) break;
case_end:
      puts("Unknown option.");
    }
    if (choice == 0) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
      exit(0);
    }
    if (choice != 1) goto case_end;
    printf("Filename: ");
    fgets(filename,64,stdin);
    null = strcspn(filename,"\n");
    filename[null] = 0;
    if ((is_premium == 0) && (env = strstr(filename,"flag"), env != (char *)0x0)) {
      puts("Forbidden file, go premium to read it!");
    }
    else {
      read_file(is_premium);
    }
  } while( true );
}
```

Now I'll explain the idea of what this does
