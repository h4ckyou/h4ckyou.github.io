We are given the binary and it's source code

Here's the C source:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void init() {
    setvbuf(stdout, 0, 2, 0);
    setvbuf(stdin, 0, 2, 0);
}

void win() {
    system("/bin/sh");
}

int main() {
    init();

    printf("Free junk: 0x%lx\n", init);
    printf("Your turn: ");

    char buf[0x10];
    read(0, buf, 0x11);
}
```

Looking at it we can see the program doesn't do much!

Here's what it does:
- Defines 3 functions i.e init, win, main
- The init function does some buffering
- The win function tends to spawn a sh shell
- The main function gives us a binary leak of the init function
- Then it receives our input and store in the buf array

The vulnerability lies in the read call because:
- The buffer is set to hold up only `0x10` bytes
- But we are reading in `0x11`

That gives us a one byte buffer overflow

At first I was like this is too easy cause there's a win function and what the hell is the leak for?

Trust me it's easy but I spent about an hour solving it lol

From this vuln we know the idea is exploiting one byte overflow to a jump to the win function which would spawn a shell

Checking the file type and protection enabled showed this:

We are working with a 32bit binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

The only protection not enabled is `Stack Canary`

Let us run the binary to see how it behaves

It is as we saw from the source code! 

I was still wondering why they gave us a elf section leak ðŸ¤”

Don't mind that I have lot of skill isses :(
