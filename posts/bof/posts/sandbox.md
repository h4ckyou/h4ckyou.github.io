<h3> Sandbox </h3>

This was a binary I saw saved on my laptop I usually do that cause in CTFs I might not be able to solve a lot of the pwn or other challenges so I usually save it randomly in my filesystem 

While I was less busy I saw it and said hmm let me give this a shot!

So here we are and I'll give you my solution used to solve it

First thing we'll check the file type and the protections enabled on it
