#### Challenge:
    - Name: EzRev
    - Description: In and out of the matrix ðŸ™‚

The file attached to this challenge is a binary called `matrix`

So we're working with a x64 executable and after running the binary it showed this

It seems that it only requires an integer which will be provided 4 times and from the result of the output we need the right input to escape the matrix

Since there's nothing much that can be done here I loaded the binary up in Ghidra

Here's the main function

Since the variable names from the pseudocode isn't looking good I renamed it

Ok it's looking good but here's the part which does not look too nice to the eyes:

```c
*(int *)(matrix + ((long)k + (long)j * 4) * 4);
```

Inorder words that piece of code is equivalent to `matrix[j][k]` so this means the data type for the global variable `matrix` isn't right

So I checked it to know the length of the array

The size is 64 and since the elements there are `DWORD --> int()` whose size is 4 bytes that means the number of elements there are 16

And from the nested inner loop which defines `j and k` it iterates till it reaches 4 twice meaning the matrix is a 4x4 matrix i.e it has 4 rows and 4 columns

At this point I changed the data type of the matrix to `int[4][4]`
