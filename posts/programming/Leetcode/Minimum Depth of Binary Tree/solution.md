Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

```
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
```

So let's take a sample binary tree to work on

First we can maybe say let's take the approach we used for solving the [maximum depth]()?
