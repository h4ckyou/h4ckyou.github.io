Given an integer `n`, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than `n`.

The question is very straight forward and it's clear on what we're to do

First my approach was I needed to find a way to get all the numbers within `n-1` range

And then iterating over the list and comparing if it's less than `n` which I'll increase the counter is the statement if True

But I had problem with generating the list of prime numbers **I suck at math which is bad :(**  so I looked at the hint and it gave the algorithm to use

Cool upon checking google on that I got [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/)

With that algorithm **Sieve of Eratosthenes** we can get the list of prime numbers within a specific `n` range

Then from that the remaining part is easy as we can just iterate through the prime numbers list and check for the condition
