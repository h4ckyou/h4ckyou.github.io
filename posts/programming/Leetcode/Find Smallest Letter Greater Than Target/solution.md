I initially tried implementing binary search algorithm but I got to a test case where it wasn't just working and i spent so many hours trying to fix it but didn't succeed :(

So I moved to solving it using Linear Search

It works but the time and space complexity is low also you can see I was trying to solve it 2 hours ago but the last test case was not working ðŸ¥²
