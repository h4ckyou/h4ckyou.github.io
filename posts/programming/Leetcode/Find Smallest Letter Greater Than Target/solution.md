I initially tried implementing binary search algorithm but I got to a test case where it wasn't just working and i spent so many hours trying to fix it but didn't succeed :(

So I moved to solving it using Linear Search

It works but the time and space complexity is low also you can see I was trying to solve it 2 hours ago but the last test case was not working ðŸ¥²

After checking the solution other people made I figured my mistake in my previous Binary Search program and I was totally over complicating it lool

Anyways here's a more efficient script: [link](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/programming/Leetcode/Find%20Smallest%20Letter%20Greater%20Than%20Target/solve.py)
