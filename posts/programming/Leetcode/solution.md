<h3> Majority Element </h3>

Here's my thought process:

```
1. We are given an array `nums` of size `n` and our goal is to return the majority element in the array
2. Majority element is defined as that element which appears more than `n/2` times
3. So lets say I have an array of size 10 the majority element should occur more than 5 times
4. To solve this I'll make a hash table which holds all the occurrence of elements in the array, then I'll check if it meets that condition and I will be expecting it to reach because the description of the challenge says we may assume that the majority element always exists in the array
```
