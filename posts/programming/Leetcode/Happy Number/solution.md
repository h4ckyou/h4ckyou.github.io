Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if `n` is a happy number, and false if not.
