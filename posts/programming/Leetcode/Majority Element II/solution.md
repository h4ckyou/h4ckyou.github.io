This is the second series of the `Majority Element` challenge

Here's my thought process:

```
1. We are given an interger array of size n, we are to find all the elements that appear more than `n/3` times
2. To solve this I'll create a hashtable which holds each element and it's corresponding number of occurrence, then I'll check if the condition is meet for each element in the hashtable
```

It works pretty well!
