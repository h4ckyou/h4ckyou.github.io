We are given an array `nums` of non negative integers. We can say `nums` is special if there exists a number `x` such that there are exactly `x` numbers in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `x`

The idea is simple we just need to find a number `x` such that there are exactly `x` numbers in the array `nums` that are greater than or equal to `x`

Let's take a example:

```
nums = [3, 5]
```

I'll take `x` as 1:

```
If x == 1 --> is there any single number in the nums array that is greater than or equal to one?
```

In this case it returns True because there are two various numbers that meets the condition

Let's take `x` as 2:

```
If x == 2 --> are there any two numbers in the nums array that are greater than or equal to two?
```

Looking at the condition we can tell that there are two numbers in the array that meet the condition

So the answer we would return is `2` and not `1` because it kinda takes the highest value 

From this first case I was able to conclude that the value of `x` doesn't essentially need to be in the array but it must be less than or equal to the length of the array i.e `x <= len(nums)`

Let us take another example:

```
nums = [0, 4, 3, 0, 4]
```

I'll take `x` as 1:

```
If x == 1 --> is there any single value in the nums array that is greater than or equal to one? --> True
```

When `x` is 2:

```
If x == 2 --> are there any two numbers in the nums array that are greater than or equal to two? --> True
```

When `x` is 3:

```
If x == 3 --> are there any three numbers in the num array that are greater than or equal to three --> True
```

When `x` is 4:

```
If x == 4 --> are there are four numbers in the num array that are greater than or equal to four --> False
```

This case returned False this means that the previous result is what will be returned as it returns True so the answer is `3`

After I understood that I was able to come up with an idea I can use to implement this and find the value of `x`:
- Initialize variable `x` as `1` because from the constraint, `1 <= nums.length <= 100` and I'll be using that in the future of this program
- In a while loop I'll iterate till `x` is less than or equal to the length of the array i.e `x <= len(nums)`
- I set a variable `count` as `0,` then I iterate through all the numbers in the number array on each iteration I'll check if `number >= x` which is the condition required for us to perform
- If that is True then I'll increment variable `count` by `1`
- I'll check if `count == x` and if it is, I'll return `x`
- Else I'll increment `x` by `1`
- If after the loop and no values is found I'll return `-1`
