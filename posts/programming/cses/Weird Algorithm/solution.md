We are given the description as:

```
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n.
If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one.
The algorithm repeats this, until n is one.

For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:
3→10→5→16→8→4→2→1
```
