During the weekend I and my team mates from `@error` participated in the ctf and we ended up 11th on the leaderboard

With me playing as user `0x1337` I solved challenges from various categories like:
- Pwn
- Reverse Engineering
- Networking
- Web

I solved all challenges from the first 2 categories and I'll be dropping my solve scripts (currently too lazy to make a writeup)
