During the weekend I and my team mates from `@error` participated in the ctf and we ended up 11th on the leaderboard

With me playing as user `0x1337` I solved challenges from various categories like:
- Pwn
- Reverse Engineering
- Networking
- Web

I solved all challenges from the first 2 categories and I'll be dropping my solve scripts (currently too lazy to make a writeup)

To view my solve scripts checkout: [here](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/tree/main/posts/ctf/knightctf24)

I didn't drop solve script for the first & second rev because they can be solved without writing a script cause:
- REV1: The password expected is stored as a variable so we can just decode it and reverse the string (endianess)
- REV2: Uses `strcmp` on our input against the expected string

The catch all the reverse challenge was that they were all Statically Linked & Stripped.....So figuring exactly the functions being used was the main thing for the second rev I suppose

Anyways that's all

GG to my team mate who solved the Web I could not do :)
