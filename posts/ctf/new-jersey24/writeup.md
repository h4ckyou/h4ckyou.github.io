### New Jersey 2024 CTF

##### It was fun and I only focused on solving the Binary Exploitation & Reverse Engineering challenges. I played with `THE TOMATO DUDES`

Currently the scoreboard is hidden though the ctf is over so i can't see our position nor user point

#### Challenges Solved:
  - Humble Beginnings (reverse)
