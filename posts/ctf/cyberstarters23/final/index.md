<h3> CyberStarters CTF '23 Final </h3>

Here are the challenges I was able to solve in the ctf which took place on the 6th May, 2023 at lasted from 9A.M - 3P.M

```
P.S:- The scoreboard was dynamic

After downloading the flag.txt file checking its content shows this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236645648-854a654b-169f-40a2-838b-cc0f21792e42.png)

Using [DcodeFr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) I identified the cipher as *DTMF Code* 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236645684-fd99503b-f0b7-4cef-bd93-d73a0439e5f9.png)

Then using its [decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/dtmf-code) I decoded it
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236645722-1f447a62-22b9-4167-a145-3b29eb9a6449.png)

On decoding it gives *681117267847012311910497116951001119511610410195110117109981011141159510910197110125*

I then used [DcodeFr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) to identify it as *ASCII Code* 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236645875-28c2a21a-5496-4d6a-8c9f-3cc24ebd1e19.png)

Then using its [decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code) I decoded it to get the flag

```
Flag: DoHCTF{what_do_the_numbers_mean}
```

#### Idan

After downloading the python file and it's output.txt I checked it out

Looking at the python code shows this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236646004-83121247-3f3e-4d30-8bfe-95af76b2b772.png)

While it's output shows this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236646017-e7a65f6e-e5b7-4b9c-8b90-96573cc604ee.png)

Using cyberchef I got this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236646298-358bff7f-4863-45e3-a7bf-6fe2979a4a6c.png)

```
Encoded Flag: GrKFWI{LGDQ_WKH_GHFUBSWRRU}
```

Then using dcodefr i got the encoded text to be affine cipher

Decoding it forms this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236681093-fc523dcf-56a1-460d-a731-f3a49549d08a.png)

```
Flag: DoHCTF{IDAN_THE_DECRYPTOOR}
```

# Forensics

#### Logger 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236646519-10d4eaf4-f64c-4015-bbbe-49716773b850.png)

After downloading the file keylog.txt and viewing its content it shows this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236646526-4dfbccf9-2fd7-432d-93f2-f2dbc9c27aa2.png)

At first this looks weird lol but after arranging it well i got this

Here's how i arranged it 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236646963-c26ea430-f1ee-4950-a38d-fab4b97e023b.png)
```bash
Command: cat keylog.txt | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr '\n' ' ' 
```

Now we can manually remove the spaces to form this 

```
844339666777555555 344277777777 6666888337 33 366666
```

Then using dcodefr you know the drill I got the cipher it is which turns out to be *Multi-tap Phone (SMS)*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236647162-5f4d3d31-8e4e-4d09-bd2f-44160e9b0b3a.png)

Decoding it forms this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236647203-c0326cb1-8016-41be-a582-c624375eda28.png)

```
THEWORLL DHASS OMVEP E DON
```

At this point it looks like readable English but somehow after a while of nobody solving it they gave this hint
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236647244-02223cec-0f6c-4331-b081-d789c3b3fef6.png)

From the hint we know that how the word should be arranged. I was able to arrange the first three words but the remaining last two were hard ðŸ˜­

Then I told my team mate @cyberhajibi and immediately she got it ðŸ’€

It turned out to be: *(Note the flag isn't case sensitive)*

# Web

#### 

Unfortunately the challs are not more up
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/236681326-cc285653-e294-4209-b2f7-0c85203fb6f8.png)

But *TD;LR*: The challenge involves a login and a register page. When we register we get directed to our account and the flag isn't there. And the page was saying something about we are not admin then looking at the login page source code *(CTRL + U)* discloses the admin email address and what we will notice is that the login submit button is disabled. Trying to register another account using the admin email shows *user already exists* trying *SQL Truncation* works now we have access over the admin account. So we can login using it but we will need to inspect element and change the disabled field to enabled then after loggin in, we get the flag 

For the second web challenge: We're given a page and only one end point in it and that endpoint involves purchasing the flag. But we are only currently having about 18000 If i can remember. Now we are not actually given a specfic amount on how much the flag worths and trying to like buy the flag shows fails ðŸ¤”

Looking at the logic of the web app we can tell that it does something like this:

```python
amount = 180000
price = 20000
buy_flag = price - amount
if buy_flag > $some_amount:
   print('Purchased')
 else:
   print('Failed')
```

Another thing we should note is that the cookie is a jwt token which when decoded gives a json array of something like:

```json
{
   "username": "guest123321",
   "flag": "0"
}
```

And it's algorithm is *HS256* . Since we don't currently have the flag the flag variable of our cookie is just zero. But if we purchase the flag it should return the flag. But now how do we achieve purchasing the flag ðŸ¤”

From the logic proposed earlier if no form of sanitation is done to check the usage of a negative number what happens :

```python
amount = -18000
price = 20000
buy_flag = price - amount
if buy_flag > $some_amount:
   print('Purchased')
 else:
   print('Failed')
```

We can see that the *buy_flag* variable will return a huge number sweeeet ðŸ˜…

After I tried that it showed purchased then on viewing the jwt decoded token gives the flag

# PWN

#### Guess

During the CTF I was unable to solve this due to my lack of knowledge on algorithm (learnt few things recently so I decided to give this a go)

The source code wasn't given but here it is
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f63c862c-54e3-4769-a6d6-3e8319ef07b0)

```python
import random

def game():
    remaining_tries = 32
    answer = random.randint(1,1000000000) 
    while remaining_tries > 0:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Guess an integer btw 1 and 1 billion\n")) 
            if guess == answer:
                print("You got it right! DoHCTF{??????????????????}\n")
                return
            elif guess < answer:
                print("Higher\n")
            else:
                print("Lower\n")
            remaining_tries -= 1
        except ValueError:
            print("Not a valid integer. Please try again.\n")
    print("Out of tries. Game over!\n")

game()
```

From the python program we see that:
- It creates a random number from 1 to a billion
- Receives our input and compares it to the right answer
- If our input is less than the answer it prints out Higher else Lower
- And we have only 32 trials in order to guess the right answer

Initially what I was trying during the ctf was to narrow down the answer

I didn't know that it was random number each time we connected to the server and that took my time lol i'm a bad ctf player

But anyways there's no way of brute forcing it because of the number of trials we have and also it will take lot of memory if we are to brute force

So what's the way here

Well the answer is using Binary Search Algorithm

What the algorithm basically does is to narrow down a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half

The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N)

You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)

Here's my solve script 

```python
# Implement Binary Search Algorithm 
from pwn import *
context.log_level = 'warning'

io = remote('127.0.0.1', '1234')

def binary_search():
    left = 0
    right = 1000000000

    while True:
        mid = (right + left) // 2
        io.sendline(str(mid).encode())

        recv = io.recv(1024).decode().strip()
        log.info(f'Flag: {recv}')
        if 'Higher' in recv:
            left = mid
            continue
        elif 'Lower' in recv:
            right = mid
        else:
            return recv

result = binary_search()
print(result)
io.close()
```

Running it works and we get the flag

```
Flag: DoHCTF{automation_is_king_}
```

#### Conclusion:

The CTF was really fun even tho the time was given to solve the challenges were quite not enough but overall I thank the organizers for hosting it and also @Lytes for his wonderful challenges

After the struggle my team took second ðŸ˜…

Till another CTF Adios ðŸ‘»
