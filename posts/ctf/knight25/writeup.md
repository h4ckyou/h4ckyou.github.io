Hi there, this contains my solution for the challenges solved during this ctf

I participated with team `QnQSec` and we placed 14th

We actually cleared all but one challenge :)

With me playing as user `0x1337` I solved challenges from various categories like:
- Pwn
- Reverse Engineering
- Networking
- Web

To view my solve scripts checkout: [here](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/tree/main/posts/ctf/knightctf25)

Would have loved to make a detailed solution but i don't know much time to write one ðŸ¥²
