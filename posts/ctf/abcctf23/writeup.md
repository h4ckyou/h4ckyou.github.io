<h3> ABCCTF Final 2023 Writeup </h3>

Hi everyone, in this writeup I'll give just the solution of the challenges which had one solve and was blooded by me

### Reveal (Binary Exploitation)

We are given a netcat instance and a zip file 

After downloading the zip file and unzipping it I got this

So it has a binary and it's libc file

Since this is given I patched the binary to use that libc because that's what going to be running on the remote instance 

I patched it using [pwninit](https://github.com/io12/pwninit)

Time to start the real deal here :P

Checking the file type and protections enabled on the binary shows this

We're working with a x64 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

All protections are enabled on this binary ðŸ’€

I decided to run it to get an idea of what it does

Cool it seems to receive our input twice

Inorder to find the vulnerability we need to decompile the binary

At first when I used Ghidra and viewed the main function I got this

```c

undefined8 main(void)

{
  undefined buffer [56];
  long canary;
  
  setup();
  canary = 0x13371337132763b7;
  write(1,
        "Tell me something thrilling and i\'ll share my dirty little secrets, nothing porn related t hough xD: "
        ,100);
  read(0,buffer,0x40);
  printf("You: %s",buffer);
  write(1,"Please, do tell me more, i\'m dying to find out: ",0x30);
  read(0,buffer,100);
  if (canary != 0x13371337132763b7) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

- Ok looking at that we can see that it assigns 56 bytes to a buffer and then it stores up a value in the `canary` variable and receives `0x40` bytes of our input which is stored in the buffer
- Our input is then put to stdout using `printf` 
- Then it receives 100 bytes of our input which is stored in the buffer
- It then compares the value stored in `canary` with `0x13371337132763b7`

From this they are two vulnerability:
- We can leak the canary value because the first input receives `0x40 (64)` bytes which is stored in the buffer and the buffer can hold up only 56 bytes so we have additional 8 bytes to overwrite then later on the buffer is displayed using `printf`
-
