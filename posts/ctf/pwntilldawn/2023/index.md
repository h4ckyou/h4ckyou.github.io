PwnTillDawn Online Battlefield's Competition 2023 Edition was an intensive 24hours competition where 60+ participants evolved within a network comprised of many machines affected by real life vulnerabilities witnessed by wizlynx group through hundreds of penetration tests conducted for companies and organizations of various sizes and industries. 

This was a really good ctf I participated in as user `@Theory`

I was feeling a bit overwhelmed when they announced they would be an upcoming CTF and this is because they hosted a CTF which I participated in but got 4th it was the Middle East and West Africa region so me taking part in the CTF opened my eyes as the boxes where so good

As I'm a big fan of solving vulnerable machines even though im a noob I couldn't wait for the ctf to arrive still :)

After few days it started and things became interesting

The number of vulnerable machines were 10

Two of the machines were MacOS but the remaining Eight were Linux

To me the machines were just so good as expected

During the ctf I spent so much time on two boxes which were easy rated I think but the privesc was so good

And I enjoyed doing the hard rated one which took me so much time 

Initially I was 6th but after I was able to shell a MacOS box it gave me lots of point lol

Then I shelled the hard one too but couldn't escalate because it was almost one hour before the ctf ends that I shelled the two

In total I was able to solve 6 out of the 10 machines which landed me 2nd position

This is also my first international ctf i'm winning so I'm really glad: [scoreboard](https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/pwntilldawn-ctf/pwntilldawn-online-battlefield-offsec-competition-2023-edition)

I'd like to thanks the organiser for their wonder effort in creating those machines 

See y'all next time :P
