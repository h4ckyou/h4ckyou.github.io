After downloading the attached file on checking it's content gave this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/39c5eeea-e5b9-4c87-9d2c-b29515ed6f41)

If you notice it you'll see that there are only just two words having multiple occurrence

So what I did was to replace `beep` to `0` and `boop` to `1` then convert to string

Here's the script I wrote to do that:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

fp = open('BeepBoop').read().split()
cnt = ''

for i in range(len(fp)):
    if fp[i] == 'beep':
        fp[i] = '0'
    else:
        fp[i] = '1'
    
for i in range(0, len(fp), 8):
    cnt += chr(int(''.join(fp[i:i+8]), 2))

print(f"Decoded: {cnt[1::]}")
```

But after running it the result wasn't the flag? 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/380fa0af-4049-40bf-939f-c6aa3c4dde60)

Ok at least it has the flag format `sun{^.*}` so I assumed this to be some sort of cipher and on using cyberchef I got it to be `rot13`

So here's the final script to get the flag: [solve](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/sunshinectf23/BeepBoop/solve.py)

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import codecs

fp = open('BeepBoop').read().split()
cnt = ''

for i in range(len(fp)):
    if fp[i] == 'beep':
        fp[i] = '0'
    else:
        fp[i] = '1'
    
for i in range(0, len(fp), 8):
    cnt += chr(int(''.join(fp[i:i+8]), 2))

flag = codecs.decode(cnt[1::], 'rot13')
print(f"Flag: {flag}")
```

Running it gives the flag

```
Flag: sun{exterminate-exterminate-exterminate}
```

#### Reversing (1/2)

#### Dill
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9970b6df-9463-4027-8b10-c6024858421f)

After downloading the attached file on checking the file type shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8a2561b6-8697-4bca-bbc1-351719de04a1)

So that's a python compiled binary whose version is 3.8

We can decompile it using [uncompyle6](https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6) 

Doing that I got this decompiled python code
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9f80ef84-2b57-4e04-a597-126608848cfc)

```python
class Dill:
    prefix = 'sun{'
    suffix = '}'
    o = [5, 1, 3, 4, 7, 2, 6, 0]

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.encrypted = 'bGVnbGxpaGVwaWNrdD8Ka2V0ZXRpZGls'

    def validate(self, value: str) -> bool:
        return value.startswith(Dill.prefix) and value.endswith(Dill.suffix) or False
        value = value[len(Dill.prefix):-len(Dill.suffix)]
        if len(value) != 32:
            return False
        c = [value[i:i + 4] for i in range(0, len(value), 4)]
        value = ''.join([c[i] for i in Dill.o])
        if value != self.encrypted:
            return False
        return True
```

Looking at this we can see that it defines a class object called `Dill` and some variables such as `prefix, suffix, o` are created, the encrypted flag is also given

The validate function of this program does this:
- First if the content of the value passed into this functon doesn't start with `sun{` and ends with `}` it will return `False`
- But if that isn't the case it will extract the value of the flag without it's prefix and suffix i.e removes `sun{}` from our provided value
- Then if the length of the extracted value isn't 32 it will return `False`
- But if it is, it will stored 4 chunks each in the array `c` of our extracted value
- Then it will map the chunk index value to the value being iterated on the array `o` and the result is stored in `value`
- The final result is then compared to the encrypted value, if it isn't the same it returns `False` else it returns `True`

Here's my solve script which just basically maps the encrypted value to it's right index position: [solve](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/sunshinectf23/Dill/solve.py)

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

encrypted = 'bGVnbGxpaGVwaWNrdD8Ka2V0ZXRpZGls'
mapping = [5, 1, 3, 4, 7, 2, 6, 0]
prefix = "sun{"
suffix = "}"

enc = [encrypted[i:i+4] for i in range(0, len(encrypted), 4)]
r = [0]*8

for idx, value in enumerate(mapping):
    r[value] = enc[idx]

r = ''.join(r)
flag = prefix + r + suffix

print(f"Flag: {flag}")
```

Running it I got the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/36f9097a-a19e-487b-a820-6439c766763d)

To confirm it's the right flag we can pass it into the `Dill.validate()` [function](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/sunshinectf23/Dill/validate.py)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7a88e436-2d2b-43cc-a3fe-719918d04ef9)

Running it return `True` which means that's the right value

We are given a remote instance to connect to

After connecting to the remote instance via netcat it showed this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/96824576-91c6-4f57-b288-41e820071db6)

Welcome to DIGITAL DANCE ROBOTS!

       -- INSTRUCTIONS --       
 Use the WASD keys to input the 
 arrow that shows up on screen. 
 If you beat the high score of  
     255, you win a FLAG!     

   -- Press ENTER To Start --
```

After pressing the `ENTER` key it showed this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a39b9539-f850-4baa-83fc-1b230dc8e866)

From reading it you can just get what we're to do

The goal is that we need to send the received arrow corresponding character key which are `W,A,S,D`. We're to repeat this process `255` times

First when I tried it I spent some time before I got it to work because the way it was doing `I/O` was weird to me but I eventually got it work

So my solution is simple and it involves basically grabbing the arrows, then iterate through every arrow in the arrows and map it to a hashtable (dictionary) containing it's corresponding key value

Then I send the concatenated result to the server for evaluation

Here's the result from running it:
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1e3dffc4-2d85-4737-8c7f-da27264e9495)

I ran it with pwntools debug mode because I was too lazy to fix the code then :(

So I had to fix it well and on running the updated one you should get this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/09dc8c52-8c05-466b-a33a-77d4d99bb738)

Here's the solve script: [solve](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/sunshinectf23/DDR/solve.py)

```
Flag: sun{d0_r0b0t5_kn0w_h0w_t0_d4nc3}
```

#### Web (2/2)

#### BeepBoop Blog 

![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e0d845a8-b52f-41ab-ab94-690bc77913ec)

Going over to the web url shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/37ee4a15-8b1b-45d6-bfc1-848366131116)

Viewing page source shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/946fa41b-248c-4393-a801-f220907ff67e)

After reading the javascript included I saw this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c379c51f-0007-4f9f-81b7-2dfd1d017a73)

So basically going over to `/posts` should return the list of posts in json

But from the challenge description there's a secret draft and we need to find it

I wasn't the one who solved this but `@Theory`

Here's his solve script: [solve](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/sunshinectf23/BeepBoop/blog.sh)

```sh
#!/bin/bash

url_base="https://beepboop.web.2023.sunshinectf.games/post/"
i=0

while true; do
    url="$url_base$i"
    response=$(curl -skS -L "$url")
    hidden_value=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.hidden')
    
    if [[ $hidden_value == "true" ]]; then
        echo "Found a response with hidden: true at $url"
        echo "$response"
        break
    else
        echo "No luck at $url"
        i=$((i + 1))
    fi
done
```


After running it we'll get the hidden post which holds the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3e09e641-421e-4383-b4be-1bdbb8898e3e)

So frustrating bash so slow well it's using curl so I guess that's the reason :)

#### Hotdog Stand
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7164a393-26a1-4bbf-8328-ae1abfbd82f9)

Going over to the url shows this

We have a login page, on checking `/robots.txt` reveals this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cc7e081d-906c-48c1-97f2-40a5186336f8)

The first two directories are invalid but the third one downloaded a file

The file type is a sqlite database
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7528e14a-4f92-4014-973e-3e0ba9fe8947)

The number of tables there are 4
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/65fb07c9-3ff5-4a54-a3db-b3369e8be5aa)

The credential table looks interesting and on dumping it I got credential

#### Pwn (2/5)

#### Array of Sunshine
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/161b4184-bff4-487f-8d11-987f530c5cd9)

After downloading the binary checking the file type shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/23bad8e4-f3f1-4fe3-83f1-e266d35b0c05)

So we're dealing with a x64 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

The protections enabled are `Canary & NX` 

I ran the binary to get an overview of what it does
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c41310de-87f9-4178-a7f4-2462df2527d4)

Ok it asks for a fruit we want to eat then asks what we want to replace it with

This looks already like a write what where (arbitrary write) sort of challenge

To identify the vulnerability I decompiled it in Ghidra

Here's the decompilation of the main function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7163cc13-8c4f-492f-83d9-c4c2e7cd3f9f)

```c
void main(void)

{
  printf_sym = sym_lookup("printf");
  scanf_sym = sym_lookup("scanf");
  logo();
  do {
    basket();
  } while( true );
}
```

- So it calls `sym_lookup` to look up the got value of `printf & scanf` and the resulting value is stored in the global variable `*_sym`
- It then calls the `logo()` function which just prints out that fruit
- In a while loop it calls the `basket()` function

Here's the decompiled code
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5d522bcb-e86a-4bdb-8b12-14a5c50bbe89)

```c
void basket(void)

{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int fruit;
  undefined *local_30;
  undefined *local_28;
  long local_20;
  undefined8 local_18;
  long canary;
  
  canary = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  printf("\nWhich fruit would you like to eat [0-3] >>> ");
  __isoc99_scanf("%i",&fruit);
  printf("Replace it with a new fruit.\n",(&fruits)[fruit]);
  printf("Type of new fruit >>>");
  __isoc99_scanf("%24s",&fruits + fruit);
  local_30 = &printf;
  local_28 = &scanf;
  local_20 = _printf;
  local_18 = _scanf;
  if ((printf_sym == _printf) && (printf_sym == _printf)) {
    if (canary != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
      __stack_chk_fail();
    }
    return;
  }
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(-1);
}
```

- First it asks for a fruit we would like to eat and it's gonna receive our input as an integer which is stored in the fruit variable let's take that as `idx`
- Then it asks us what we would want to replace it with and receives 24 bytes of our input as a string which is stored in the `fruit[idx]`
- It compares the value of `print_sym` to the value stored in `_printf` which is the got of `printf` the logic is done again (pretty weird I'll say why this happens later)
- Does the canary check and returns
- But if the comparison returns false it would exit

The global variable `fruits` contains 4 values
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f36ed0f6-1794-4503-842d-22b024fc95e1)

This is how it looks like in IDA, pretty neat right?

There's also a win function which would give us the flag
