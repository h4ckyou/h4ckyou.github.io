#### INITIAL DETAILS 
I wanted to make a detailed solution.......... but eventually felt lazy to do so

So you can view the solve script of some challenges: [link](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/blob/main/posts/ctf/urchinsec23/)

#### FINAL DETAILS

The organizers put a prize on the best writeup that would be provided then I came back here to make a detailed writeup! ðŸ˜¸

I will be writing on the crypto, pwn and rev challenges that I solved.

So we're working with a x64 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

Running it keeps printing out `6` for some reason

Decompiling it in Ghidra and going over to the main function shows this

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  sexyprime();
  return 0;
}
```

Nothing really there except that it calls the `sexyprime` function

Here's the decompiled `sexyprime` function
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/4918dd40-aede-41e4-a019-a9664fdeee65)

```c
void sexyprime(void)

{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  long canary;
  
  canary = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  printf("%d",6);
  if (canary != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}
```

Looking at it we can see it just indeeds prints out `6` but is that all?

Ghidra does not seem to decompile the binary well I have no idea why, but if you take a look at the assembly decompilation you'd see it does some other stuffs

At some point it's supposed to receive user input but that check isn't being reached

So I decided to manually step through each instruction to figure why it doesn't work

I set a breapoint at the `sexyprime` function:

```
break *sexyprime
```

At `sexyprime+58` I saw that it compares the value of `$rbp-0x80` to `0x6`, checking the current value shows it's right

Moving to the next 3 instructions shows another comparism

The reason it would fail is because of this:

```
mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x7c], 0x10
```

The value of `$rbp-0x7c` would be `0x10` and when it's compared to `0x6` that would return False

In this case it would fail and if it does it would jump to `sexyprime+1701` which would `ret` and the program would exit
