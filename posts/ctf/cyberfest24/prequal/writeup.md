Ohh this challenge was pretty easy but I spent some time on it

First I downloaded the attached file and on checking it's content I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/93bf8cb5-364b-4e23-8b32-3fcc6fa9a7d5)

```
6182665f351415600b57005b5f80fd
```

I started thinking this was some sort of hex value ðŸ’€

Well after trying I got back to the challenge and read the "description"

```
Our contact says Nuk deployed a contract using EIP-3855 .

The hexcode calldata of a transaction that will not revert is said to be the key.
```

I am not a Web3 person but from reading this I knew it was related to Web3

Ok time for some research, first thing I had to search what was "EIP-3855" meant
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7754334c-1a98-41ea-9fde-ae88047fb5dc)

Most of what I was seeing was just "PUSH0 instruction"

I tried to learn about "EIP" but didn't succeed as I could not find any where to get a general basic of what it is

Now i decided to work back with what I have

From reading [this](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3855-push0-instruction/7014/2) it made me conclude that the hex value given as the challenge is a bytecode because the links based on "EIP-3855" was referencing opcode (operational code) and instructions, you can also use the challenge name to conclude your assumption is right (`Byteops`)

Now that I know this I had to find a way to decompile the bytecode

Searching it up on google gave [this](https://ethervm.io/decompile) and trying to use it worked
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0d9793fc-379e-4ad8-8606-56f70de6dbda)

```c
contract Contract {
    function main() {
        var var0 = 0x8266;
        // Unhandled termination
    }
}

label_0000:
	0000    61  PUSH2 0x8266
	0003    5F  5F
	// Stack delta = +1
	// Outputs[1] { @0000  stack[0] = 0x8266 }
	// Block terminates

	0004    35    CALLDATALOAD
	0005    14    EQ
	0006    15    ISZERO
	0007    60    PUSH1 0x0b
	0009    57    *JUMPI
	000A    00    *STOP
	000B    5B    JUMPDEST
	000C    5F    5F
	000D    80    DUP1
	000E    FD    *REVERT
```

Ok good now we decompiled it what next?

Well we need to understand what it does and each opcode has the operation it performs so I searched for the opcode list and got [this](https://ethervm.io/#82)

Before diving into the bytecode we can see that some portion was decompiled correctly and it defines a contract `Contract` where the `main` function stores a value `0x8266` in variable `var0`

At this point of seeing it I went back to the challenge and read the description

```
The hexcode calldata of a transaction that will not revert is said to be the key.
````

This looks like the right input to this challenge so I tried it but unfortunately it didn't work

I did spam lot of it though ðŸ’€

Now let's understand what the bytecode does

First I'll write what each opcode translates too

```
PUSH2 - Pushes a 2-byte value onto the stack
CALLDATALOAD - Reads a (u)int256 from message data
EQ - (u)int256 equality
ISZERO - (u)int256 is zero
PUSH1 - Pushes a 1-byte value onto the stack
JUMPI - conditional jump if condition is truthy
STOP - Halts execution of the contract
JUMPDEST - Metadata to annotate possible jump destinations
PUSH0 - Shanghai hardfork, EIP-3855: pushes 0 onto the stack
DUP1 - clones the last value on the stack
REVERT - Byzantium hardfork, EIP-140: reverts with return data
```

Harmed with this instruction let's translate what it does

- First it pushes a 2 byte value onto the stack then pushes 0 to the stack

At this point let's visualize the stack as an array, then it should hold this:

```
[0x8266, 0x0]
```

- Next it reads an unsigned int from the message data
- Then it compares our input with the value on the stack (i presume)
- If it's equal it stops else it reverts

Ok pretty straight forward we just need to provide the value that would make the contract not to revert, and for that to happen the value oughts to be `0x8266`

But when I submitted that as flag it wasn't working

I then decided to work with this dynamically, basically seeing how it works during runtime

Searching for how I could achieve that lead me to [evm_playground](https://www.evm.codes/playground)

This is how it looks like
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b82f9fd9-97a5-447f-a803-5f883dd7ad21)

So I change the default bytecode there to the one we have
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d43c9858-bc5b-4105-947e-a4e4df2b9546)

One thing to note there is that the `Calldata` form is where we pass in input as hex in this case the value we want to check

First i tried using the value it's compared to which is `0x8266`

Starting it's execution shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/997f2adc-77e4-435f-befa-180d86c15261)

We can click on `next instruction`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/bb513182-fdef-4eea-807c-54b546dad3ae)

After the `CALLDATALOAD` instruction we see our given value has multiple 0's
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cdc0139f-2466-496e-aa05-d6c720ff4d5a)

I don't really know how i can say this but i think it's just like how memory address are when it uses msb to represent data

Like in this case `CALLDATALOAD` reads an unsigned 256 bits int

When I checked the size of `(u)int256` in solidity I got it to be `2^256-1`

If you compute that and compare it with the length of the value we have you should see this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b92348fd-b1da-4844-854d-dc50cad5a81f)

This means it's just alligned based on the size of the data type

When we continue the execution it will hit `REVERT` because of course the values aren't equal
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/837368f9-ab18-487a-a5b0-5713a82e1af3)

So here's the value I used

```
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008266
```

Using that the execution hits `STOP` which means this is the expected value

We can then submit that :)

```
Flag: ACTF{0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008266}
```
