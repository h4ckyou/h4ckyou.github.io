It's clearly referring to the main page of the site, so I went over there, viewed page source and got the flag

```
Flag: ACTF{dont_skip_cutscenes}
```

### Say Hello

Head over to their accounts, follow them go back to the ctf platform then submit `Yes` :)

```
Flag: Yes
```

### Do you read 2

Just submit that 

```
Flag: actf{i_did_not_skip_this_cutscene}
```

### ByteOps

Ohh this challenge was pretty easy but I spent some time on it

First I downloaded the attached file and on checking it's content I got this

```
6182665f351415600b57005b5f80fd
```

I started thinking this was some sort of hex value ðŸ’€

Well after trying I got back to the challenge and read the "description"

```
Our contact says Nuk deployed a contract using EIP-3855 .

The hexcode calldata of a transaction that will not revert is said to be the key.
```

I am not a Web3 person but from reading this I knew it was related to Web3

Ok time for some research, first thing I had to search what was "EIP-3855" meant

Most of what I was seeing was just "PUSH0 instruction"

I tried to learn about "EIP" but didn't succeed as I could not find any where to get a general basic of what it is

Now i decided to work back with what I have

From reading [this](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3855-push0-instruction/7014/2) it made me conclude that this has to deal with some bytecode because it was referencing opcode (operational code) and instructions, you can also use the challenge name to make your assumption right (`Byteops`)

I am familiar with assembly so this was not too difficult to conclude

Now that I know this
