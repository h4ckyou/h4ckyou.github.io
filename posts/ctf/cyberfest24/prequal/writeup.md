Not pretty much so let's get to it ðŸ˜‰


### Do you read

It's clearly referring to the main page of the site, so I went over there, viewed page source and got the flag

```
Flag: ACTF{dont_skip_cutscenes}
```

### Say Hello

Head over to their accounts, follow them go back to the ctf platform then submit `Yes` :)

```
Flag: Yes
```

### Do you read 2

Just submit that 

```
Flag: actf{i_did_not_skip_this_cutscene}
```

### ByteOps

Ohh this challenge was pretty easy but I spent some time on it

First I downloaded the attached file and on checking it's content I got this

```
6182665f351415600b57005b5f80fd
```

I started thinking this was some sort of hex value ðŸ’€

Well after trying I got back to the challenge and read the "description"

```
Our contact says Nuk deployed a contract using EIP-3855 .

The hexcode calldata of a transaction that will not revert is said to be the key.
```

I am not a Web3 person but from reading this I knew it was related to Web3

Ok time for some research, first thing I had to search what was "EIP-3855" meant
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7754334c-1a98-41ea-9fde-ae88047fb5dc)

Most of what I was seeing was just "PUSH0 instruction"

I tried to learn about "EIP" but didn't succeed as I could not find any where to get a general basic of what it is

Now i decided to work back with what I have

From reading [this](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3855-push0-instruction/7014/2) it made me conclude that the hex value given as the challenge is a bytecode because the links based on "EIP-3855" was referencing opcode (operational code) and instructions, you can also use the challenge name to conclude your assumption is right (`Byteops`)

Now that I know this I had to find a way to decompile the bytecode

Searching it up on google gave [this](https://ethervm.io/decompile) and trying to use it worked

```c
contract Contract {
    function main() {
        var var0 = 0x8266;
        // Unhandled termination
    }
}

label_0000:
	0000    61  PUSH2 0x8266
	0003    5F  5F
	// Stack delta = +1
	// Outputs[1] { @0000  stack[0] = 0x8266 }
	// Block terminates

	0004    35    CALLDATALOAD
	0005    14    EQ
	0006    15    ISZERO
	0007    60    PUSH1 0x0b
	0009    57    *JUMPI
	000A    00    *STOP
	000B    5B    JUMPDEST
	000C    5F    5F
	000D    80    DUP1
	000E    FD    *REVERT
```

Ok good now we decompiled it what next?

Well we need to understand what it does and each opcode has the operation it performs so I searched for the opcode
