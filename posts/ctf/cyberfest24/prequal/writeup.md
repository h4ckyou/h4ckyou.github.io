This challenge was pretty much created due to a rant about why there were no very trivial challs ðŸ˜„

-- We asked for it...

Now let's get to it

Going to the attached url doesn't show anything

Viewing page source reveals nothing also

On checking `/robots.txt` reveals this path

Trying to access it downloads an attachment

I ran it and got this message

At this point when solving it I actually had to `CTRL+C` because during the prequal there was a rev chall which would logout the current session so I thought it was the same but luckily it wasn't

Searching for low hanging fruits revealed the flag

```
Flag: aCtF{robotTxt_and_strings_as_requested}
