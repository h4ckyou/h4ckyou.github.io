### Puts in boot [First Blood ðŸ©¸]

We are given a binary file attached to it

Checking the file type shows this

We are working with a x64 binary which is dynamically linked and not stripped

From the result of checksec on this binary we can tell that the binary has no protection enabled on it

What looks interesting is the fact NX is disabled meaning that the stack is executable

It receives our option prints some word

Using ghidra I decompiled the binary 

Here's the main function
