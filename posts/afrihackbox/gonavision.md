Hi, this is my first writeup for the AfriHackBox platform and i'll be showing you how I solved the Gonavision lab

So first things first we need to get the list of open ports on the host and my preferred choice of doing that is `rustscan & nmap (cause why not??)`

```r
- rustscan -a 10.0.1.5 -r 1-65535
- nmap -sCV -A 10.0.1.5 -p80
```

Going over to the web service running shows this

Trying some sqli as the username/password doesn't work so i moved on from messing with the login page

From this we can tell that this is an application created by `Nikhil Bhalerao` so the ideal thing is to probably search up "RedCock Farm" and see what comes up

But now, I didn't solve it that way and i'll show you how i did it

What I did next was to fuzz for files and specifically `php` because the application programming language is that ðŸ’€

Ok so we got various files

The `register.php` looks interesting because if we can register a user then we can probably login and see other functions we can access

Another interesting thing to note is that, even though the other files return a status code of 302, which implies a redirect, their content length is absurdly large and we'll get to that soon

So first thing i did was to try register

But after submitting the form i got this error, dang!

This means we can't register a user (it seems!)

What next?

Well time to check out why those files which were supposed to do a "redirect" happens to have a large content length

If we try access it we will notice that it immediately redirects to the `/index.php` file
