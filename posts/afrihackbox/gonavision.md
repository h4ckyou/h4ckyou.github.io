Hi, this is my first writeup for the AfriHackBox platform and i'll be showing you how I solved the Gonavision lab

So first things first we need to get the list of open ports on the host and my preferred choice of doing that is `rustscan & nmap (cause why not??)`

```r
- rustscan -a 10.0.1.5 -r 1-65535
- nmap -sCV -A 10.0.1.5 -p80
```

Going over to the web service running shows this

Trying some sqli as the username/password doesn't work so i moved on from messing with the login page

From this we can tell that this is an application created by `Nikhil Bhalerao` so the ideal thing is to probably search up "RedCock Farm" and see what comes up

But now, I didn't solve it that way and i'll show you how i did it

What I did next was to fuzz for files and specifically `php` because the application programming language is that ðŸ’€

Ok so we got various files

The `register.php` looks interesting because if we can register a user then we can probably login and see other functions we can access

Another interesting thing to note is that, even though the other files return a status code of 302, which implies a redirect, their content length is absurdly large and we'll get to that soon

So first thing i did was to try register

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/063c5283-8901-4344-b968-e5cf4e92ee40)

But after submitting the form i got this error, dang!
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30037d8b-d2e2-484e-bbcd-a3bc01aa18fe)

This means we can't register a user (it seems!)

What next?

Well time to check out why those files which were supposed to do a "redirect" happens to have a large content length

If we try access it you will notice that it immediately redirects to the `/index.php`

This is how i went about bypassing that

I captured the request with Burp Suite and then I intercepted the response to the request and modified the http status code to 200

This is the equivalent in python
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075cea51-2387-4e18-9549-16abfe2fb417)

```python
import requests

url = "http://10.0.1.5/"
res = requests.get(url + "store.php", allow_redirects=False)

print(res.text)
```

If we save the html response and view in our browser we'd see this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/231114a8-7c88-474b-b82f-67b6ed66527c)

But why does this work exactly?

This is a class of web vulnereability called [Execute After Redirect](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Execution_After_Redirect_(EAR))

From this I was able to get other php files hosted on the server (by viewing the page source of the store.php html content)

After looking through them I got something juicy which is `product.php`

I accessed it using the burp method as that reserves images/css making it look much better

We have the ability to upload a photo (screams.. file upload bypass)

The first thing which came to mind was to upload a php file (obviously)

But on intercepting the upload request i got this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42f83e42-fec3-43de-9615-efd45cdbb751)

Notice how it's actually uploading to the wrong file? `index.php` rather than `product.php`

I sent that request to Repeater and here's the response
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93c9843b-08f2-4ded-b144-9a6ec37a03b2)

Doesn't seem to error? I then searched for the file i uploaded in the response and boom i saw this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d40fbee-5229-4ace-b5c0-714421d0d0a0)

Looks like it uploaded to: `assets/img/productimages/a.php`

Accessing it showed this, so we have gotten RCE on the host...

Nice lab pwned!

The flag location is at: `/etc/passwd`

Thanks for reading!
