## STKOF

### Overview

*STKOF* is a pwnable heap based challenge that deals with an older version of glibc (2.23), we exploit an heap overflow inorder to corrupt a chunk metadata and subsequently perform the *unlink* attack, taking advantage of that to gain arbitrary read/write. Using that we get info leaks and overwrite the got of *free* to *system* to spawn a shell.
