In this blog post, I'll be sharing my personal experience as a first time participant of the International Cybersecurity Challenge (ICC) during it's fourth (4th) edition representing the Africa Regional Cybersecurity Committee (AFRICC) competing against the top qualified players from 8 regions covering the whole globe.
