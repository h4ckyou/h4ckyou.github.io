**-> About Me?**

I'm Mark Uche, but most know me as h4cky0u. I've always been fascinated by how things work, digging into systems to understand them from the ground up. That curiosity naturally drew me into offensive security, a field where exploring, breaking, and mastering systems isn't just allowed, it's essential.

Right now, I'm focused on pwn and reverse engineering, taking things apart, understanding their logic, and turning that knowledge into something powerful.

Whether it's solving a binary, sharpening my skills, or simply grinding through challenges, I enjoy the feeling of growth that comes from pushing myself.

Outside the terminal, I dive into music and anime, finding inspiration, energy, and the occasional spark of madness that keeps me moving forward. I'm still figuring out a lot of things, but every day teaches me something new.

See you at the top!
